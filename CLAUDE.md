## What is NearBy?

NearBy is a **hyperlocal trust commerce platform** that connects customers with verified local shops
(kirana stores, vegetable vendors, pharmacies, restaurants, pet stores, mobile shops, furniture stores)
for on-demand delivery by local delivery partners.

**The core thesis:** Dark stores (Blinkit, Zepto) win on speed. NearBy wins on **trust, authenticity,
and community.** Every order placed keeps money in the local neighbourhood economy.

**We are NOT building:** A dark store. An inventory-holding business. A competitor to Blinkit on speed.

## The Four Apps

| App | Users | Platform | Purpose |
|-----|-------|----------|---------|
| Customer app | End customers | React Native + Expo | Browse shops, order, track, review |
| Shop owner app | Kirana/pharmacy/etc owners | React Native + Expo | Manage shop, accept orders, inventory |
| Delivery partner app | Local gig workers | React Native + Expo | Accept assignments, GPS tracking |
| Admin dashboard | NearBy ops team | React + Vite | KYC review, disputes, monitoring |

## Complete Tech Stack (DO NOT DEVIATE WITHOUT ADR)

```
Mobile:      React Native + Expo (customer, shop, delivery apps)
API:         Node.js + Express (backend/src/)
Real-time:   Socket.IO (order events, GPS tracking, chat)
Database:    Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostGIS) — managed
Cache/Queue: Redis (self-hosted on DO) + BullMQ
Search:      Typesense (self-hosted on DO)
Storage:     Cloudflare R2 (product images = public, KYC docs = private)
CDN/Security:Cloudflare (free plan — DNS, DDoS, SSL, CDN)
Payments:    Cashfree (1.75% — NOT Razorpay)
SMS/OTP:     MSG91 (₹0.18/SMS — NOT Twilio)
Push notif:  Firebase FCM (free)
Maps:        Ola Maps API (1M free calls/month — NOT Google Maps)
Hosting:     DigitalOcean Bangalore (2vCPU/4GB, $24/mo)
Deploy:      Coolify + Docker on the DO droplet
Admin web:   React + Vite (served by Coolify on same droplet)
Monitoring:  Grafana + Prometheus (self-hosted on DO)
ORM:         Prisma (for Supabase/PostgreSQL)
Image proc:  Sharp.js (resize before R2 upload)
```

**Why these choices (critical context):**
- Cashfree over Razorpay: 1.75% vs 2% commission. Better split-payment API for shop settlements.
- MSG91 over Twilio: ₹0.18 vs ₹2.50 per SMS. Mandatory for Indian DLT compliance.
- Ola Maps over Google Maps: 1M free calls/month. Better India-specific address data.
- Typesense over Elasticsearch: Runs in single Docker container, 500MB RAM. Geo search + typo tolerance built in.
- DO Bangalore over AWS: India DC = 10ms latency for Hyderabad users. $24/mo vs ₹8,000+/mo.
- Cloudflare R2 over AWS S3: Zero egress fees. Free 10GB. CDN included.
- Supabase over self-hosted PG: Managed backups, RLS, auto REST API. Free tier covers V1.

## Key Domain Rules (Enforce These Always)

### Orders
- Order total is ALWAYS calculated server-side from DB product prices. Never trust client-sent price.
- Order has a 3-minute acceptance window. BullMQ `autoCancel` job fires exactly at 3:00.
- Stock is locked (decremented) at order creation, not at payment. Reversed if payment fails.
- Idempotency key (UUID) sent with every order creation request. Checked in Redis before processing.
- Order statuses (in order): `pending → accepted → packing → ready → assigned → picked_up → out_for_delivery → delivered`
- Cancellable statuses: `pending`, `accepted`. NOT cancellable after `picked_up`.

### Payments
- Cashfree webhook MUST verify HMAC signature before any processing.
- Webhook handler is idempotent — check if payment_id already processed.
- Partial refunds supported (when shop removes an unavailable item from active order).
- COD orders skip payment gateway entirely — order created directly.

### Authentication & Authorization
- All users login via phone OTP only. No passwords.
- JWT payload: `{ userId, phone, role, shopId? }` — shopId only for shop_owner role.
- Roles: `customer` | `shop_owner` | `delivery` | `admin`
- Every route has `roleGuard(allowedRoles)` middleware.
- OTP: 6 digits, 5-minute TTL in Redis, 3-attempt lock (10-minute lockout), auto-read Android.

### Trust Score
- Formula: `(avg_rating × 0.40) + (completion_rate × 0.35) + (response_score × 0.15) + (kyc_bonus × 0.10)`
- Recomputed nightly at 2 AM IST via BullMQ scheduled job.
- Score 0–100. Badges: Trusted (80+), Good (60–79), New (40–59), Review (<40).
- Below 40 → admin alert + FCM warning to shop.
- Trust score drives Typesense search ranking.

### Real-time / GPS
- Delivery partner GPS sent every 5 seconds via Socket.IO emit.
- GPS stored in Redis with `GEOADD delivery:{orderId}` — TTL 30 seconds.
- NOT stored in Supabase (write cost, no need for history during active delivery).
- ETA computed via Ola Maps Distance Matrix API on every GPS update.
- GPS trail stored temporarily only for active disputes (30-day retention, then deleted).

### Search
- All shop/product search via Typesense (NOT Supabase direct queries).
- Shop indexed when: KYC approved, is_open toggled, trust_score updated.
- Product indexed when: created, stock toggled, price updated, deleted.
- Out-of-stock products hidden from search within 15 seconds of toggle.
- Geo radius: default 3km, expandable to 5km if fewer than 5 results.

### File Storage (Cloudflare R2)
- Product images → `nearby-products` bucket (public) — served via CDN.
- KYC documents → `nearby-kyc` bucket (private) — only accessible via signed URLs (5-min TTL).
- Images resized with Sharp.js before upload: 600×600 full, 150×150 thumbnail.
- Never store file content in Supabase — only R2 URLs.

### Notifications
- Primary channel: Firebase FCM push notification.
- Fallback: MSG91 SMS (when FCM fails or user has no app token).
- All notifications queued via BullMQ — never sent synchronously in request handlers.
- Critical alerts (order for shop) use FCM `priority: high` + custom sound.

## Environment Variables Reference

All vars defined in `.env.example`. Never commit `.env` to git.
Critical variables that break everything if missing:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-side DB access
- `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — payment security
- `JWT_SECRET` — authentication
- `REDIS_URL` — everything async
- `MSG91_AUTH_KEY` — OTP delivery

## API Conventions

- Base URL: `https://api.nearby.app/api/v1`
- All responses: `{ success: true, data: {...} }` or `{ success: false, error: { code, message } }`
- Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer {jwt}`
- Pagination: `?page=1&limit=20` — response includes `meta: { page, total, pages }`
- Error codes: ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `ORDER_NOT_FOUND`, `OTP_LOCKED`)
- Timestamps: ISO 8601 UTC (`2026-03-28T11:30:00Z`)
- Currency: Always in paise (integer) internally, converted to rupees only at display layer
- IDs: UUID v4 everywhere. Never sequential integers exposed.

---

## Socket.IO Room Naming

```
order:{orderId}      — customer + shop + delivery for one order
shop:{shopId}        — all orders for a shop, new order notifications
shop:{shopId}:chat   — pre-order chat for a specific shop
delivery:{partnerId} — assignment notifications to delivery partner
admin                — admin monitoring room
```

---

## Database Quick Reference

Key tables: `profiles`, `shops`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`, `reviews`, `disputes`, `messages`

RLS is enabled on `orders` — customers see only their orders, shop owners see only their shop's orders.
Admin role bypasses RLS using `service_role` key (backend only, never exposed to clients).

Supabase migrations run in order: `supabase db push` or apply SQL files sequentially.

---

## BullMQ Queue Names

```
notify-shop          — fired when order placed (FCM + SMS to shop)
assign-delivery      — fired when shop accepts (find nearest partner)
auto-cancel          — delayed 3min, cancelled if shop doesn't respond
notify-customer      — order status changes to customer
trust-score          — nightly scheduled at 2 AM IST
analytics-aggregate  — nightly scheduled at 3 AM IST
earnings-summary     — weekly on Monday 9 AM IST
typesense-sync       — async shop/product index sync (3 retries, 2s backoff)
review-prompt        — 2 min after delivery → FCM to customer
```

## What AI Assistants Should NEVER Do

1. **Never suggest switching the tech stack** without creating an ADR first.
2. **Never store prices in client requests** — always fetch from Supabase.
3. **Never skip HMAC verification** on Cashfree webhooks.
4. **Never use Google Maps** — Ola Maps only.
5. **Never use Razorpay** — Cashfree only.
6. **Never use AWS S3** — Cloudflare R2 only.
7. **Never use Twilio** — MSG91 only.
8. **Never store GPS in Supabase** during active delivery — Redis only.
9. **Never trust client-sent order totals** — always calculate server-side.
10. **Never expose admin JWT role** to any client-side code.
11. **Never commit .env files** — use .env.example with placeholder values.
12. **Never write sequential IDs** — UUID everywhere.

---

## How to Ask AI Assistants for Help

When asking Claude/Cursor/Copilot for help, always provide:
1. Which module you're working on (`backend/src/routes/orders.js`)
2. Which sprint you're in (see SPRINT_PLAN.md)
3. The specific feature or bug
4. Paste the relevant code + error

Example prompt:
> "I'm working on NearBy backend, Sprint 7 (Customer App). I need to implement the home screen
> in `apps/customer/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`. The screen should: fetch nearby shops from
> Typesense, display as grid with category chips, show trust badges and distance."

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
